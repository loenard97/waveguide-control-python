This project contains the source code for the waveguide experiments of the [AG Widera](https://www.physik.uni-kl.de/en/widera) group at the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/en/).

We mainly research Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamonds.
This project is a GUI Tool that controls our microscopy setups, with which we collect our data.
